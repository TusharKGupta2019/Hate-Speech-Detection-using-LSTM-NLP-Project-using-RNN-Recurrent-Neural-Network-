In this project, I learned how to leverage a powerful combination of machine learning techniques to build a Hate Speech Detection model using LSTM and NLP.

Key highlights of the project include:

Data Preprocessing:

Used Pandas to load and manipulate the dataset.

Leveraged SpaCy for text preprocessing tasks like lemmatization and stopword removal.

Performed one-hot representation on the text data.


Oversampling:

Addressed class imbalance using the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) library.


Model Development:

Implemented a LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model using TensorFlow and Keras.

Trained the model for 10 epochs with a batch size of 32, achieving high accuracy.


Model Evaluation:

Evaluated the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualized the confusion matrix using Seaborn to analyze the model's performance.

The project demonstrates the effectiveness of LSTM networks in capturing long-range dependencies in text data and accurately classifying hate speech. 
By combining NLP techniques with deep learning, this project pushes the boundaries of text classification and has important applications in online moderation and content filtering.
